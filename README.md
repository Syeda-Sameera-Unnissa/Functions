# Python Functions: Learning Journey with Generative AI

Welcome to my learning journey on **Functions in Python**, enhanced with the power of Generative AI! This repository documents my progress as I dive into essential Python concepts, focusing on functions and related topics. Join me as I explore, practice, and master these concepts step by step.

## Syllabus

### 1. Functions
- **Definition and Syntax:** Understanding the anatomy of a Python function.
- **Parameters and Arguments:** Learning about positional, keyword, and default arguments.
- **Return Values:** Exploring how functions return data.
- **Variable Scope:** Understanding local and global scope.
- **Docstrings:** Writing clear and concise documentation for functions.
- **Nested Functions:** Creating functions inside functions.
- **Recursive Functions:** Solving problems using recursion.

### 2. Iterators & Generators
- **Iterators:**
  - What are iterators?
  - Creating custom iterators using classes.
  - The `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.
- **Generators:**
  - Understanding the `yield` keyword.
  - Benefits of generators over iterators.
  - Building efficient pipelines with generator expressions.

### 3. Lambda, Map, Reduce, and Filter
- **Lambda Functions:**
  - Writing anonymous, one-liner functions.
  - Use cases and limitations.
- **Map:**
  - Transforming sequences using the `map()` function.
  - Combining `map()` with lambda functions.
- **Filter:**
  - Filtering sequences with the `filter()` function.
  - Using `filter()` alongside lambda expressions.
- **Reduce:**
  - Aggregating sequences using `reduce()`.
  - Common examples (e.g., sum, product).

## Objectives
By the end of this learning journey, I aim to:
- Gain a strong understanding of Python functions and their applications.
- Effectively use iterators and generators to handle data streams.
- Master functional programming concepts using lambda, map, reduce, and filter.
- Build reusable and efficient code structures using the learned techniques.
